Integration notes for Tasks 1â€“5

Summary
- Created an integration MVP branch scaffold with a FastAPI backend, Postgres, and Ollama services wired via docker-compose.yml.
- Ensured backend/.env.example includes Ollama variables (OLLAMA_HOST, OLLAMA_PORT, OLLAMA_MODEL, OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL) and Postgres configuration.
- Added a minimal health endpoint that also reports Ollama connectivity.

What remains for full parity with the source branches
- Merge and reconcile the full database schema/models and Alembic migrations from feature branches.
- Implement questionnaire engine APIs and persistence.
- Integrate conversation agent endpoints using Ollama with configurable model.
- Reconcile multiple Alembic heads and create a merge migration once all models are in place.
- Seed the NIST CSF dataset via migrations or a seed script.

Smoke test (local)
- docker compose up --build
- GET http://localhost:8000/health -> returns { status: "healthy", ollama: { ... } } (Ollama reachable flag depends on local availability)

Notes
- This MVP favors the latest compose/backend wiring and provides a stable base to complete the remaining merges and conflict resolution.
- Once the model and API merges are applied, run alembic migrations and add a merge migration if multiple heads are detected.
